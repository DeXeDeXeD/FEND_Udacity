				<p>
					Axolotl are special salamanders, thanks to four pigmentation genes they present different color variants. Amphibian, but sometimes they're just too bored to start walking on the ground, and spend all of their lifes in the water. Unfortunately, due to pollution and fishing this little monster is almost extinct in free nature. The Axolotl is carnivorous.
